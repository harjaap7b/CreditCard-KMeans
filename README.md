# CreditCard-KMeans
## Credit Card Customer Segmentation

In this project I will be working for a credit card company as data scientist with the task of analyzing customer data to segement the population. The dataset contains information about the company's clients which we will use to segment the client population into different types in order to give the marketing team a more targeted approach. It has been decided that we should use the K-Means model to segment the data.
